# Oradew - Oracle (PL/SQL) Development Workspace

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/mickeypearce0384/Oradew/_apis/build/status/mickeypearce.oradew-vscode)](https://dev.azure.com/mickeypearce0384/Oradew/_build/latest?definitionId=1)

This extension allows you to develop your Oracle (PL/SQL) project in Visual Studio Code. It enables you to:

- Manage PL/SQL source code with version control (Git)
- Compile files and Run statements with ORA errors problem matching
- Package files into a single SQL deployment script
- Deploy to multiple environments in one click

## Installation

Install the extension and start with `Oradew: Initialize Workspace` command.

### Prerequisites (local)

- Node.js 8.16 or later, Node.js 10.16 or later, or Node.js 12
- Git
- SQL\*Plus or SQLcl

### Container

An Oradew VS Code development container is available [here](https://github.com/mickeypearce/oradew-vscode-container) with all prerequisites preinstalled.

## Workspace

A default workspace structure:

```
./deploy                Deployment package
./scripts               SQL Scripts (DDL, DML, files, etc)
./src                   Source with PL/SQL objects
./test                  Unit tests
dbconfig.json           DB environment configuration (required)
oradewrc.json           Workspace configuration
```

## Commands

### Basic Workflow

**Setup**

- `Initialize Workspace` - Create configuration files (`dbconfig.json` and `oradewrc.json`) and a clean workspace structure
- `Create Source from DB` - Create Source files from existing DB objects

**Build**

- `Compile Changed Files` (F6) - Compile changed Source files in working tree to DB
- `Compile Current File` - Compile Source object (or any file with a single SQL or PL/SQL statement)
- `Run Current File as Script` (F5) - Execute a SQL script (with SQL\*Plus or SQLcl)
- `Run Selected Statement` (Ctrl+Enter) - Execute a SQL query or PL/SQL statement with autoCommit and dbms_output enabled

**Install**

- `Package` (F9) - Generate a deployment script from project files
- `Deploy...` - Run deployment script on the selected environment (with SQL\*Plus or SQLcl)

### Additional

- `Import Source` (Shift+F6) - Walk Source files and import matching DB object from DB
- `Import Current File` - Import matching DB object
- `Import Selected Object` - Import new object from DB into a Source file
- `Compile Source` - Walk Source files and compile each file to DB
- `Toggle Compile Watch` - Start/End compilaton on save. Compile working tree automatically whenever a Source file changes.
- `Package Delta` (Shift+F9) - Package current version changes. Command extracts changed file paths from Git history - starting from latest tagged commit (last version) up to the last commit (HEAD)
- `Run tests` - Compile unit test files
- `Generate...` Generate PL/SQL code with a code generator

### Switch environment

- `Set DB Environment` - Set DB environment that will be used when executing commands. Pick list is generated from `dbconfig.json`. The default value is `DEV`.
- `Clear DB Environment` - Set DB environment to `<None>`. This means that you choose DB environment every time you execute DB command.

### Switch user

- `Set DB User` - Set DB user that will be used when executing commands. Pick list is generated from `dbconfig.json`. The default value is `<Auto>` (user extracted from file path).

## Configuration

### DB environment

Only `dbconfig.json` file is required for the workspace activation and successful connection with your database. Multiple DB environments with multi-users per environment are supported. A minimal example with `DEV` environment and a single schema user follows:

```json
{
  "DEV": {
    "connectString": "localhost/orclpdb",
    "users": [{ "user": "hr", "password": "welcome" }]
  }
}
```

Create `dbconfig.json` manually in the root folder of your workspace or execute `Init Workspace` command.

### Workspace

Workspace supports a base configuration file (`oradewrc.json`) and an additional configuration file for each environment (`oradewrc.DEV.json`, `oradewrc.TEST.json`, etc.). The base configuration settings apply to all environments, unless an environment specific configuration file exists that extends the base.

Default values will be used in the case workspace configuration file is not present. The following settings are available (defaults):

```json
{
  "compile.warnings": "NONE",
  "compile.force": true,
  "compile.stageFile": false,
  "source.input": ["./src/**/*.sql"],
  "source.encoding": "utf8",
  "source.pattern": {
    "packageSpec": "./src/{schema-name}/PACKAGES/{object-name}.sql",
    "packageBody": "./src/{schema-name}/PACKAGE_BODIES/{object-name}.sql",
    "trigger": "./src/{schema-name}/TRIGGERS/{object-name}.sql",
    "typeSpec": "./src/{schema-name}/TYPES/{object-name}.sql",
    "typeBody": "./src/{schema-name}/TYPE_BODIES/{object-name}.sql",
    "view": "./src/{schema-name}/VIEWS/{object-name}.sql",
    "function": "./src/{schema-name}/FUNCTIONS/{object-name}.sql",
    "procedure": "./src/{schema-name}/PROCEDURES/{object-name}.sql",
    "table": "./src/{schema-name}/TABLES/{object-name}.sql",
    "synonym": "./src/{schema-name}/SYNONYMS/{object-name}.sql"
  },
  "import.ease": false,
  "import.getDdlFunction": "dbms_metadata.get_ddl",
  "package.input": ["./scripts/**/initial*.sql", "./src/**/*.sql", "./scripts/**/final*.sql"],
  "package.exclude": ["./scripts/**/+(file|run)*.sql"],
  "package.output": "./deploy/{schema-name}.sql",
  "package.encoding": "utf8",
  "package.templating": false,
  "test.input": ["./test/**/*.test.sql"],
  "version.number": "0.0.1",
  "version.description": "New feature",
  "version.releaseDate": "2099-01-01"
}
```

- `compile.warnings` - PL/SQL compilation warning scopes. The default value is `NONE`.
- `compile.force` - Ignore conflict detection. If object you are compiling has changed on DB (has a different DDL timestamp), you are prevented from overriding the changes with a merge step. Resolve merge conflicts if necessary and than compile again. Set to `false` to turn on conflict detection. The default value is `true`.
- `compile.stageFile` - Automatically stage file after succesfully compiled (git add). Default value is `false`.
- `source.input` - Glob pattern for Source files. Used by general `Compile`, `Import` and `Create` command to match files that are targeted. For example, to compile only "HR" schema and exclude "HR" tables, set: ["./src/HR/**/\*.sql", "!./src/HR/TABLES/\*.sql"].
- `source.encoding` - Encoding of Source files. (ex.: "utf8", "win1250", ...) The default value is `utf8`.
- `source.pattern` - Define custom source structure by specifing mappings for different object types. Ommited object types won't get exported. Path variables {schema-name} can also be omitted. Single schema pck ex: {"packageSpec": "./src/pck/{object-name}-spec.sql", "packageBody": "./src/pck/{object-name}-body.sql"}
- `import.ease` - When set to `true`, it will import only DB objects that changed on DB in comparision to project Source files. Default value is `false`.
- `import.getDdlFunction` - Custom Get_DDL function name. Use your own DB function to customize import of object's DDL. It is used by `Import` commands. The default value is `DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL`.
- `package.input` - Array of globs for packaging files into deployment script file (package.output). `Package Delta` command populates it with changed file paths.
- `package.output` - Deployment script file path. Script is created with `Package` command by bundling input Source files and Scripts; wrapped with "SPOOL log" and "COMMIT;". Path variable {schema-name} is used to group files by schema into separate scripts. It can be used anywhere in the path or omitted altogether.
- `package.exclude` - Array of globs for excluding files from packaging. Scripts that start with "file" or "run" by default.
- `package.encoding` - Encoding of deployment script file. (ex.: "utf8", "win1250", ...) The default value is `utf8`.
- `package.templating` - Turn on templating of config variables. Use existing ('\${config[\"version.releaseDate\"]}') or declare a new variable in config file and than use it in your sql file. Variables are replaced with actual values during packaging. The default value is `false`.
- `test.input` - Array of globs for matching test files. Executed with `Run tests` command.
- `version.number` - Version number
- `version.description` - Version description
- `version.releaseDate` - Version release date

### Code Generator

Write a PL/SQL function on database, add a definition to configuration file (`oradewrc-generate.json`) and then use `Generate...` command to execute your generator. A new file with the generated content will be created in your workspace.

#### Function specificaton

The generator function on DB has to have the following specification (parameters):

```sql
FUNCTION updateStatement(
  object_type IN VARCHAR2,    -- derived from path of currently open ${file}
  name IN VARCHAR2,           -- derived from path of currently open ${file}
  schema IN VARCHAR2,         -- derived from path of currently open ${file}
  selected_object IN VARCHAR2 -- ${selectedText} in editor
) RETURN CLOB;
```

Function parameters are derived from currently opened file and selected text in your editor when the generator is executed. The first three parameters (`object_type`, `name`, `schema`) are deconstructed from the path of the currently opened \${file} as `./src/${schema}/${object_type}/${name}.sql`, whereas `selected_object` is the currently \${selectedText} in editor.

#### Generator definition

Create a configuration file `oradewrc-generate.json` in your workspace root with a definiton:

```json
  "generator.define": [
    {
      "label": "Update Statement",
      "function": "utl_generate.updateStatement",
      "description": "Generate update statement for a table"
    }
  ]
```

The `label` and `function` properties are required for a generator to be succesfully defined (`description` is optional). Use `output` property to specify a file path of the generated content (also optional). If the `output` is omitted a file with unique filename will be created in ./scripts directory.

<b>NOTE</b>: Generators have a separate repository over here: [Oradew Code Generators](https://github.com/mickeypearce/oradew-generators). Your contributions are welcomed!
